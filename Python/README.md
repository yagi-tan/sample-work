These are just random longer code snippets that I commonly use during testing.

# `tcp_*.py`

Basic TCP client/server implementation. Either run them both with proper host/port set, or use `netcat`.

# `udp_rtp.py`

UDP client for sending audio data in RTP protocol to specific target. Only useful in SIP-related situation.

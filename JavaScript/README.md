# [usb_web_backend](./usb_web_backend)

This folder implements REST+WebSockets interface for setting up and accessing data from logic analyser, as done in [this module](../C/usb_host_low). It's only the backend part, and not really tested for high sampling rate (huge resulting data may give problem to handling).
